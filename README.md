# TITANIC-CLASSIFICATION
In this project, I explored the iconic Titanic dataset to predict passengers' survival outcomes using machine learning techniques. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, every step was an exciting exploration of data science principles.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiling insights into the demographics of Titanic passengers, I delved deep into the correlations between features like age, gender, and passenger class, visualizing intriguing patterns and trends.

Feature Engineering: Crafting new features from existing data was a creative process. I engineered meaningful features such as family size and fare categories, enriching the dataset and enhancing the predictive capabilities of the models.

Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with a range of classification algorithms, I meticulously trained and fine-tuned models to achieve optimal performance. Rigorous evaluation ensured the selection of the most effective predictive model.

Model Evaluation: Leveraging evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, I rigorously assessed the performance of the trained models, ensuring their reliability and effectiveness.

Key Takeaways: This project provided invaluable insights into the intricacies of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. It was not just about building a predictive model but also about the journey of discovery and growth in the field of data science.

Excited to share this project with the GitHub community!
